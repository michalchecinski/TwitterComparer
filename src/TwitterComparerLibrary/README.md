Library for 'business logic' of whole project. 

I considered split logic and presentation layers for modularity and testability purposes.

Any layer and project for presenting information can be added. It doesn't matter if it is ASP.NET MVC, Xamarin app or UWP app. This library will drive the information.

It also had positive impact to testability. Any method can be unit tested.
